<h1> Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)-in-R </h1>

There are several submodels in HLM <a href="http://books.google.com.my/books/about/Hierarchical_Linear_Models.html?id=uyCV0CNGDLQC">(Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002)</a>. For instances:

1. The One-Way ANOVA with Random Effects (Unconditional model).
2. One-way ANCOVA with Random Effects.
3. Means-as-Outcomes Regression.
4. Random-Coefficient Regression Model.
5. Intercepts-and-Slopes-as-Outcomes.

My purpose of doing this is to gain better understanding of how to perform HLM using packages <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html">(nlme)</a>.
