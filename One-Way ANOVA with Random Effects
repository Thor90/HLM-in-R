# The One-Way ANOVA with Random Effects (Unconditional model)
Level 1: Yij = β0j + rij [1.0] 
where rij~ N(0,σ^2) # Level-1 residual that is normally distributed

Level 2: Level 2: β0j = γ00 + u0j [1.1] 
where u0j~ N(0,τ_00) # Level-2 random effects

Substituting [1.1] into [1.0] yields the multilevel model:
Combination: Yij= γ00 + (u0j + rij) [1.2] # terms inside () are random effects
where u0j~ N(0,τ_00) and rij~ N(0,σ^2)

ICC= τ_00/(τ_00+σ^2) 
1. Measurement of the degree of dependency of individuals
2. Percentage of variance of DV that can be explained by the 'Group-Level'
